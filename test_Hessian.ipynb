    "One model structure we have examined for related selective emitter applications (i.e. solar thermophotovoltaics) is the \"critically-coupled\" selective emitter.  Such an emitter may include both a Bragg reflector component (alternating transparent materials like glass and titania) and a weak-absorber (which may be an alloy of a metal and a transparent material, or may take on some other form).  The point of the former component is to strongly reflect light across a range of wavelengths, and the point of the latter is to absorb light across a range of wavelengths.  When the absorption and reflection ranges are well-mateched, critically coupling can be achieved whereby the absorbing layer ultimately absorbs almost all incident light in a limited wavelength range.  This property also gives the structure the ability to thermally emit light in that same wavelength range.  This model is promising because the reflection wavelength range can be tuned fairly easily in Bragg reflectors by choice of layer thickness and choice\n",

Analysis that might give insight takes inspiration from chemistry, where \"normal modes\" of a molecule are identified as the unique modes of motion, some of which are responsible for changing a molecule from one structure to another.  The normal modes for a molecule are obtained by first constructing the so-called Hessian matrix of the molecule (the second derivative of energy with respect to all possible changes in the atom positions), then identifying the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  The eigenvectors represent the normal modes of motion and the eigenvalues represent their frequency (related to their energy).  Incidentally, IR spectroscopy probes the frequency/energy of such normal modes.\n",
