    "### Optimization of a radiative cooling structure\n",
    "This notebook will optimize a multi-layer structure inspired by Raman  ùëíùë°   ùëéùëô. , Nature 515, 540-546 (2014), utilizing analytic gradients of the three terms that dominate\n",
    "the radiative flux: absorption of solar radiation, absorption of atmospheric thermal radiation (both warming), and thermal emission (cooling).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that explit angle and polarization dependence will be included in these gradients, and so each gradient evaluation will be ~14 times slower than comparable gradient evaluations when angle- and polarization dependence are ignored as in other optimization demos [see, for example, here](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/CODE/wptherml/example/Incandescent_Opt.ipynb)**."
